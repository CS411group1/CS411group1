As a logged-in user (refer to 1), I want to search up artists and get cheap options of flight tickets to their concertâ€™s location (Refer to 2) and back to 
my original city the day after. This way, I will be getting the cheapest options for a round-trip to the city in which the concert is. 
(The app will already know the date of the concert. So, the user will be getting the cheapest options to fly the day before and then the day after.)
